# Cognitive Field Architecture
### A Structural Geometry of Human Cognition

This project proposes a non-mystical, scientifically leaning framework for understanding human cognition as a set of structured attentional orientations rather than as personality labels.

It reframes the familiar "cognitive functions" into a clear geometric architecture:

**Field Awareness (horizontal)** → tuning to what exists *between* things  
**Depth Awareness (vertical)** → tuning to what exists *within* things

Organised across three orthogonal planes of cognition:

---

## 1️⃣ Emotional Meaning Plane
- **Fe** — shared emotional field awareness  
- **Fi** — internal emotional truth depth  

---

## 2️⃣ Rational Order Plane
- **Te** — external functional system field  
- **Ti** — internal structural logic depth  

---

## 3️⃣ Perceptual Reality Plane
- **Ne** — possibility / conceptual expansion field  
- **Ni** — convergent meaning depth  
- **Se** — real-time sensory field  
- **Si** — internal continuity / embodied memory depth  

Together, these form a stable **geometry of mind** rather than a typology identity system.

## Why This Exists

This framework does not reject typology traditions. Instead, it reframes their insights within a structural model that treats cognition as part of a dynamic, layered system of awareness rather than a fixed identity category.
The goal is to describe stabilisation patterns in a way that remains grounded, humane, and open to rigorous examination.
 
This framework aims to:

- move from labels → architecture  
- traits → attentional bias  
- mysticism → cognition  
- type fandom → testable model  

It treats cognitive functions as:
- regulation strategies  
- domains of sensitivity  
- predictable stability anchors  

These can potentially be measured, observed, and modelled scientifically.

## Core Ideas (In One Glance)

- Human cognition self-organises around field vs depth orientation  
- Each plane represents a stabilisation domain:
  - emotional regulation  
  - rational order  
  - perceptual grounding  

- People habitually anchor to different regions of the geometry  
- Under stress, people retreat to familiar strategies  
- This helps explain:
  - conflict misunderstanding  
  - relational friction  
  - why we experience different "realities"  
  - growth and development paths

## Tone and Positioning

This is **not**:
- a quiz  
- a fandom space  
- a belief system  

This **is**:
- a structural cognitive framework  
- precise, sober, grounded  
- open to scientific scrutiny

## Current Status and Intent

This project does not present itself as a rigorously validated psychological model. It is a conceptual architecture — a hypothesis about how cognition may be organised — intended to inspire inquiry and provide a structured lens for thinking about emotional, rational, and perceptual regulation. Its claims should be treated as theoretically interesting rather than empirically confirmed.

This model is offered as a thoughtful theoretical framework rather than a finished scientific claim. It represents an attempt to describe cognition in a structured way that could be explored, tested, challenged, refined, or even partially disproven in the future. Like much of the surrounding work, it exists in the space between lived experience, conceptual clarity, and potential research — not in the space of completed academic proof.

Relationship to Other Repositories

Dynamic-Field-Model [(DFM)](https://davidabau.github.io/Dynamic-Field-Model/)
CFA describes the internal geometry of cognition—how perception, emotion, and rational processing interact as a dynamic field. DFM builds outward from this, exploring how internal cognitive fields participate in larger dynamic systems, including behaviour, feedback loops, regulation, and interaction with environments.

Meaning–Myth–and–Metaphysics [(MMM)](https://davidabau.github.io/Meaning-Myth-and-Metaphysics/)
While CFA remains grounded and structural, MMM explores how humans create meaning frameworks, symbolic narratives, and mythic perspectives around experience. CFA provides the cognitive architecture, while MMM explores how minds interpret experience through symbolic worldviews.

Idea Orientation Guide [(IOG)](https://davidabau.github.io/idea-orientation-guide/)
CFA explains how awareness shifts and stabilises. The Idea Orientation Guide takes this further by offering practical navigation tools for relating to ideas, beliefs, and information in grounded and healthy ways.

Oscillation & Amplification [(O&A)](https://davidabau.github.io/Oscillation-Amplification/)
CFA explains the movement of awareness across emotional, rational, and perceptual fields. Oscillation & Amplification builds on this to explore how AI systems amplify, stabilise, or distort these cognitive fields, and what healthy human–AI relationships require.
