Cognitive Field Architecture
A Structural Geometry of Human Cognition

This project proposes a non-mystical, scientifically-leaning framework for understanding human cognition as a set of structured attentional orientations rather than as personality labels.
It reframes the familiar “cognitive functions” into a clear geometric architecture:

Field Awareness (horizontal) → tuning to what exists between things

Depth Awareness (vertical) → tuning to what exists within things

Organised across three orthogonal planes of cognition:

Emotional Meaning Plane

Fe — shared emotional field awareness

Fi — internal emotional truth depth

Rational Order Plane

Te — external functional system field

Ti — internal structural logic depth

Perceptual Reality Plane

Ne — possibility / conceptual expansion field

Ni — convergent meaning depth

Se — real-time sensory field

Si — internal continuity / embodied memory depth

Together, these planes form a stable geometry of mind rather than a typology identity system.

Why This Exists

Most “typology” systems drift into pop psychology, identity cosplay, or unfalsifiable storytelling.
This framework attempts to:

move from labels → architecture

move from traits → attentional bias

move from mysticism → cognition

move from type fandom → testable model

It treats cognitive functions as:

regulation strategies

domains of sensitivity

predictable stability anchors

…which can be measured, observed, and potentially modelled scientifically.

Core Ideas in One Glance

Human cognition self-organises using field vs depth orientation.

Each plane represents a foundational stabilisation domain:

emotional regulation

rational order

perceptual grounding

Different people habitually anchor to different parts of the geometry.

Under stress, we retreat to familiar stabilisation strategies.

This explains:

conflict misunderstanding

relational friction

why different people “live in different realities”

developmental growth paths

This model emerged from lived human experience, not from abstract theorising.

Tone & Positioning

This is not:

a personality quiz

a fandom model

a belief system

a mythology layer

This is:

a structural cognitive framework

precise

sober

grounded in lived psychology

open to scientific scrutiny

If future researchers, psychologists, AI theorists, or thoughtful humans find something useful here, that’s enough.

Origin

This architecture didn’t come from academic distance.
It emerged from a real moment of relational tension, curiosity, and a refusal to dismiss another person’s inner experience as “wrong.”
It grew from human care, not from theory ambition.

That grounding matters.
