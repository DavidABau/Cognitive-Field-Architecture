# Cognitive Field Architecture
### A Structural Geometry of Human Cognition

This project proposes a non-mystical, scientifically leaning framework for understanding human cognition as a set of structured attentional orientations rather than as personality labels.

It reframes the familiar "cognitive functions" into a clear geometric architecture:

**Field Awareness (horizontal)** → tuning to what exists *between* things  
**Depth Awareness (vertical)** → tuning to what exists *within* things

Organised across three orthogonal planes of cognition:

---

## 1️⃣ Emotional Meaning Plane
- **Fe** — shared emotional field awareness  
- **Fi** — internal emotional truth depth  

---

## 2️⃣ Rational Order Plane
- **Te** — external functional system field  
- **Ti** — internal structural logic depth  

---

## 3️⃣ Perceptual Reality Plane
- **Ne** — possibility / conceptual expansion field  
- **Ni** — convergent meaning depth  
- **Se** — real-time sensory field  
- **Si** — internal continuity / embodied memory depth  

Together, these form a stable **geometry of mind** rather than a typology identity system.

## Why This Exists
 
This framework aims to:

- move from labels → architecture  
- traits → attentional bias  
- mysticism → cognition  
- type fandom → testable model  

It treats cognitive functions as:
- regulation strategies  
- domains of sensitivity  
- predictable stability anchors  

These can potentially be measured, observed, and modelled scientifically.

## Core Ideas (In One Glance)

- Human cognition self-organises around field vs depth orientation  
- Each plane represents a stabilisation domain:
  - emotional regulation  
  - rational order  
  - perceptual grounding  

- People habitually anchor to different regions of the geometry  
- Under stress, people retreat to familiar strategies  
- This helps explain:
  - conflict misunderstanding  
  - relational friction  
  - why we experience different "realities"  
  - growth and development paths

## Tone and Positioning

This is **not**:
- a quiz  
- a fandom space  
- a belief system  

This **is**:
- a structural cognitive framework  
- precise, sober, grounded  
- open to scientific scrutiny
