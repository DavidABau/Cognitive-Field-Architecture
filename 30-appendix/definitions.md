# Definitions
### Core Terms Used in the Cognitive Field Architecture

This document defines key concepts used throughout the model.
The goal is clarity, precision, and scientific readability.

# Foundational Concepts

---

## Cognition (as used in this model)

Not “thinking.”
Not “intelligence.”

Here cognition means:

> the organisation of attention, perception, meaning-making, and regulation
> that keeps a person psychologically coherent enough to function.

It includes:
- how we perceive reality
- how we stabilise emotion
- how we impose or understand order
- how we remain psychologically safe

---

## Stabilisation Strategy

Each function represents a **way the psyche keeps reality stable.**

It is not:
- a trait
- a skill
- an identity

It is:
- an anchor point
- a regulatory process
- a habitual solution to existential instability

---

## Anchor

An anchor is the **primary place a nervous system goes to stabilise itself**.

Examples:
- Fe anchors stability in connection and shared emotion
- Ti anchors stability in internal conceptual truth
- Si anchors stability in continuity and memory
- Ne anchors stability in possibility

Anchors form because:
- they worked early in life
- they reliably regulate distress
- they organise experience coherently

Anchors are intelligent, not flawed.

---

## Plane

A cognitive plane is a **domain of stability**.

There are three:

1️⃣ Emotional Meaning Plane  
2️⃣ Rational Order Plane  
3️⃣ Perceptual Reality Plane  

Each plane answers a different existential question:

Emotional:  
> “How do I know what matters and where I belong emotionally?”

Rational:  
> “How do I know what makes sense and how order exists?”

Perceptual:  
> “How do I know what reality is and how to navigate it?”

Each plane contains multiple stabilisation strategies.

## Field Awareness (Horizontal)

Field Awareness refers to attentional bias toward:

- what exists *between* people, systems, or states
- shared environments
- dynamic relational or structural contexts
- emergent systems

It stabilises reality externally.

Field awareness tends to be:
- relational
- environmental
- systemic
- public-facing
- interactive

Functions expressed as Field processes:
- Fe (emotional field)
- Te (functional system field)
- Ne (possibility field)
- Se (present sensory field)

“Field” does **not** mean extroversion in the social sense.
It means external coherence.

---

## Depth Awareness (Vertical)

Depth Awareness refers to attentional bias toward:

- what exists *within* a being, idea, or experience
- essence
- integrity
- internal structure
- continuity

It stabilises reality internally.

Depth awareness tends to be:
- principled
- identity-rooted
- internal
- private
- anchoring

Functions expressed as Depth processes:
- Fi (emotional truth depth)
- Ti (structural logic depth)
- Ni (convergent meaning depth)
- Si (continuity depth)

“Depth” does **not** mean introversion in the social sense.
It means internal coherence.

---

# Function Definitions

Each function below is defined as a **stabilisation mechanism**, not a personality trait.

---

## Emotional Plane

### Fe — Emotional Field
Stabilises by aligning with shared emotional atmosphere.
Protects belonging, harmony, and relational coherence.

### Fi — Emotional Depth
Stabilises by anchoring to internal emotional truth.
Protects authenticity, dignity, and identity coherence.

---

## Rational Plane

### Te — Functional Field
Stabilises by organising external systems.
Protects functionality, execution, and operational reality.

### Ti — Structural Depth
Stabilises by refining internal logical structure.
Protects conceptual truth, precision, and principled reasoning.

---

## Perceptual Plane

### Ne — Conceptual Field
Stabilises by expanding possibility and alternatives.
Protects openness, creativity, and non-entrapment.

### Ni — Meaning Depth
Stabilises by converging toward deep interpretive coherence.
Protects meaning, trajectory, and symbolic understanding.

### Se — Sensory Field
Stabilises by grounding in present physical reality.
Protects immediacy, contact, and embodied truth.

### Si — Continuity Depth
Stabilises by anchoring in familiarity and lived continuity.
Protects stability, precedent, and memory-rooted identity.

# Integration

Integration is not balance.
It is not fixing weaknesses.
It is not becoming different.

Integration means:

> widening what “safe enough to stay present” can mean.

It is:
- tolerance expansion
- capacity building
- legitimacy of multiple anchors

---

# Collapse

Collapse occurs when:
- stabilisation fails
- anchors cannot regulate
- threat overwhelms capacity

Collapse often leads to:
- over-reliance on primary anchor
- rigidity
- panic
- emotional or cognitive narrowing

Collapse is not weakness.
It is a nervous system overwhelmed.

---

# Health

In this model, psychological health means:

- a stable primary anchor
- access to other forms of coherence
- decreasing fear of different stabilisation strategies
- ability to coordinate across planes
- compassion for different kinds of minds

It does not mean sameness.
It means **resilient diversity.**
