# Cognitive Field Architecture — Model Summary

This document provides a single-glance overview of the Cognitive Field Architecture:
a structural model of cognition organised around **Field Awareness vs Depth Awareness**
across **three orthogonal cognitive planes**.

The goal is not to label personalities.
The goal is to describe **how minds stabilise reality**.

## Core Principle

Human cognition organises itself using two fundamental attentional directions:

**Field Awareness (Horizontal)**
- tuning to what exists *between* things  
- systems, dynamics, atmosphere, environment, interaction  
- relational or structural “field sensing”

**Depth Awareness (Vertical)**
- tuning to what exists *within* things  
- essence, meaning, integrity, internal coherence  
- interior comprehension and truth-sensing  

Every cognitive domain expresses this same pattern.

# The Three Cognitive Planes

Each plane represents a foundation of human functioning and psychological stability.
Each plane contains a Field expression and a Depth expression.

---

## 1️⃣ Emotional Meaning Plane

This plane governs **how we stabilise emotional reality and meaning**.

### Fe — Emotional Field
- awareness of shared emotional environment  
- group tone, belonging, social equilibrium  
- “how are *we* emotionally arranged?”  

### Fi — Emotional Depth
- awareness of internal emotional truth  
- authenticity, identity coherence, personal values  
- “what is emotionally true *within* me / you?”  

Together they describe how humans orient to emotional meaning:
either through **shared relational fields** or **inner moral/emotional truth**.

---

## 2️⃣ Rational Order Plane

This plane governs **how we stabilise logic, order, and functioning**.

### Te — Functional Field
- awareness of objective function and execution  
- efficiency, logistics, organisation, output  
- “is the system working?”  

### Ti — Structural Depth
- awareness of internal logical precision  
- conceptual integrity, principled reasoning, elegant structure  
- “is the logic fundamentally true?”  

Together they describe how humans stabilise rational order:
either through **external functionality** or **internal correctness**.

---

## 3️⃣ Perceptual Reality Plane

This plane governs **how we engage reality, possibility, and continuity**.

### Ne — Conceptual Field
- openness to possibility  
- pattern-emergence, alternatives, potential trajectories  
- “what could this become?”

### Ni — Meaning Depth
- convergence toward distilled insight  
- inner symbolic compression, coherent interpretation  
- “what does this *really* mean?”

### Se — Sensory Field
- direct attunement to present sensory reality  
- immediacy, physical detail, responsiveness  
- “what is happening now?”

### Si — Continuity Depth
- anchoring to embodied memory and lived continuity  
- stability through experience, familiarity, precedent  
- “how does this connect to what has been true?”

Together these describe how humans stabilise reality:
through **possibility**, **interpretation**, **presence**, or **continuity**.

# The Geometry

Across all planes, the same structural pattern repeats:

- Outer shared reality ↔ Inner intrinsic reality  
- Field ↔ Depth  
- Horizontal ↔ Vertical  
- External coherence ↔ Internal coherence  

This produces a **stable cognitive geometry** rather than a typology chart.

```
Field ---------------------- Depth
(Between) (Within)
```

Stacked across three planes, cognition forms a **tri-plane architecture**.

# What This Model Explains

This framework helps clarify:

- why people experience the same situation differently  
- why some regulate through harmony vs authenticity  
- why some need structure vs conceptual clarity  
- why some ground in reality vs possibility  
- why conflict arises across planes  
- why stress pushes people back to their habitual stabilisation strategies  
- how development integrates more of the geometry over time  

---

# Not a Typology — A Cognitive Architecture

This is not:
- a personality test  
- identity branding  
- a fandom model  

It is intended as:
- a structural description of attentional organisation  
- a framework for emotional regulation + cognition interaction  
- something that can be
  - behaviourally observed  
  - neurologically studied  
  - computationally modelled  

---

# Status

This summary describes the **stable backbone** of the model.
Details and deeper clarifications exist in the Core Geometry section of the repository.

This document is meant to let a reader see:
“the whole forest at once.”
