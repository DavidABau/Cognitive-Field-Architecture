# Emotional Meaning Plane
### Fe / Fi — How Minds Stabilise Emotional Reality

The Emotional Meaning Plane describes how humans orient to emotional reality,
psychological meaning, and relational existence.

This plane is not about “being emotional.”
It is about **how emotional meaning becomes stable enough to live with.**

Like all planes in the model, it is organised around:

- Field Awareness (horizontal)
- Depth Awareness (vertical)

---

## Fe — Emotional Field Awareness
### Shared Emotional Reality

Fe stabilises emotional meaning by tuning to the **shared emotional environment**.

It is oriented toward:
- social atmosphere
- collective mood
- relational alignment
- group belonging
- interpersonal coherence

Its attention naturally moves **between** people rather than within them.

Fe perceives:
- tension in a room
- warmth, unity, or exclusion
- when the “relational field” is stable or unstable
- how one action will ripple through the emotional ecosystem

This is not people-pleasing.
It is **field regulation**.

Fe is the capacity to treat emotions as:
- collective
- environmental
- dynamic
- relationally interdependent

Fe stabilises by making the emotional world **coherent together**.

---

## Fi — Emotional Depth Awareness
### Interior Emotional Truth

Fi stabilises emotional meaning by tuning to **internal emotional truth**.

It is oriented toward:
- authenticity
- dignity
- personal integrity
- inner coherence
- lived emotional reality inside the self and others

Its attention naturally moves **within** rather than between.

Fi perceives:
- sincerity vs performance
- whether a feeling is “real” or hollow
- whether identity is congruent or distorted
- whether emotional experience matches inner reality

This is not selfishness.
It is **depth regulation**.

Fi is the capacity to treat emotions as:
- personal
- morally anchored
- identity-rooted
- meaningful because they arise from truth

Fi stabilises by making the emotional world **honest and internally real**.

## Field vs Depth on this Plane

Both are valid.
Both are intelligent.
Both solve different emotional problems.

Fe solves:
- disconnection
- fragmentation
- interpersonal instability
- emotional isolation
- relational breakdown

Fi solves:
- falseness
- hollow conformity
- emotional dishonesty
- identity erosion
- moral disintegration

They describe **different emotional stabilisation strategies**, not character traits.

## Why Humans Clash on This Plane

Many emotional conflicts are not really about content.
They are about **different emotional anchor points**.

Examples:

- Fe may see Fi as cold, selfish, uncooperative, or withholding warmth.
- Fi may see Fe as fake, manipulative, shallow, or socially compliant.
- Fe may feel violated when harmony breaks.
- Fi may feel violated when authenticity breaks.

Both are protecting something sacred:

Fe protects **the bond.**  
Fi protects **the truth.**

Most relational misunderstandings make sense when viewed through this geometry.

## Stress Behaviour

When stressed:

### Fe under stress
- over-attunes to the emotional field
- feels responsible for other people’s feelings
- experiences relational pressure, guilt, panic, or shame
- may suppress personal truth to preserve the field

### Fi under stress
- withdraws emotionally
- withholds warmth until trust is proven
- rejects environments perceived as inauthentic
- may cut off or become morally rigid

Again, both are intelligible stress responses to their chosen stabilisation method.

## Healthy Integration on This Plane

Growth is not “switching sides.”
Growth is **widening bandwidth.**

Healthy Fe learns:
- to honour personal truth
- to allow emotional dissatisfaction to exist
- to tolerate temporary disharmony when truth is necessary

Healthy Fi learns:
- to recognise sincerity appearing imperfectly
- to allow connection before full certainty
- to tolerate human messiness without withdrawing entirely

Integration is not sameness.
It is mutual legitimacy.

## Summary

The Emotional Meaning Plane answers the question:

**How does a mind stabilise emotional reality?**

Fe:
> By aligning with the shared emotional field.

Fi:
> By anchoring to inner emotional truth.

Together they describe the geometry of emotional regulation rather than a personality category.

This plane interfaces continuously with the Rational Plane and the Perceptual Plane.  
Meaning, order, and reality are always co-creating human experience.
