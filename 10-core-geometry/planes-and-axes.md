# Core Geometry — Planes and Axes

This document defines the structural architecture of the Cognitive Field Model.

The model describes cognition not as personality categories, but as **a spatial organisation
of attentional bias and regulation strategies**.

At its foundation are two fundamental attentional directions:

---

## Field vs Depth Orientation

### Field Awareness (Horizontal Axis)
- attention tuned to **what exists between things**
- social fields, structural fields, perceptual fields
- environment, dynamics, interaction, atmosphere
- relational coherence, system alignment, contextual awareness

### Depth Awareness (Vertical Axis)
- attention tuned to **what exists within things**
- essence, integrity, truth, meaning, continuity
- internal coherence rather than external alignment
- “core reality” rather than “shared reality”

Every cognitive domain expresses this same relationship:
**horizontal field ↔ vertical depth**.

This creates a universal axis pair:

## The Three Planes

Human cognition is stabilised across **three foundational planes**:

1️⃣ Emotional Meaning Plane  
2️⃣ Rational Order Plane  
3️⃣ Perceptual Reality Plane  

Each plane contains its own Field expression and Depth expression.

These planes are **orthogonal**:
they are distinct but interact constantly.

# 1️⃣ Emotional Meaning Plane

This plane governs how humans stabilise emotional reality and psychological meaning.

It contains:

**Fe — Emotional Field**
- shared emotional tone
- social equilibrium
- relational belonging
- group affect dynamics

**Fi — Emotional Depth**
- internal emotional truth
- authenticity
- identity coherence
- moral/emotional integrity

They are not “traits.”
They are **two different stabilisation anchors**.

Some people regulate emotion by aligning with the emotional field.
Others regulate emotion by anchoring to inner emotional truth.

This explains:
- why Fe types feel group tension like pressure
- why Fi types distrust “surface social warmth”
- why conflict is often not about content, but **different emotional stabilisation strategies**

---

# 2️⃣ Rational Order Plane

This plane governs how humans stabilise thinking, clarity, and order.

It contains:

**Te — Functional Field**
- external system coherence
- efficiency, execution, logistics
- “is the system working?”

**Ti — Structural Depth**
- internal logical precision
- principled consistency
- elegant conceptual structure
- “is the logic fundamentally true?”

Again, these are **not preferences**.
They are **different anchors of rational stability**.

This explains:
- why Te feels urgent responsibility to impose order
- why Ti rejects bad reasoning even when it “works”
- why Te sees “what works” while Ti sees “what is correct”

Field --------------------------- Depth
(Between) (Within)
```

# 3️⃣ Perceptual Reality Plane

This plane governs how humans stabilise reality, possibility, and continuity.

It contains:

**Ne — Conceptual Field**
- unfolding possibility
- alternative frames
- pattern emergence

**Ni — Meaning Depth**
- convergent interpretation
- distilled symbolic understanding
- inner sense of “what this really is”

**Se — Sensory Field**
- direct in-the-moment contact
- concrete real-time detail
- immediacy of experience

**Si — Continuity Depth**
- embodied memory
- precedent
- stability across time
- lived continuity

This explains:
- why some people ground in “what is happening now”
- others ground in “what has been consistently true”
- others ground in “what this might become”
- others ground in “what this deeply means”

Different anchors.
Same plane.

# Geometry Summary

Across all three planes, the same structural law repeats:

- outer coherence ↔ inner coherence  
- shared field ↔ intrinsic reality  
- horizontal awareness ↔ vertical awareness  

This forms **a tri-plane cognitive architecture**:

```
       Emotional Plane
    Field -------- Depth

       Rational Plane
    Field -------- Depth

       Perceptual Plane
    Field -------- Depth
```

Stack these planes and cognition forms a **stable multidimensional structure**
rather than a flat list of traits.

# Why This Matters

This geometry makes it possible to understand:

- why humans experience reality differently  
- why conflict emerges between planes  
- why stress pushes people back to their “anchor point”  
- why some seek harmony, some truth, some function, some stability  
- why typology never worked as shallow labels, but *does* work as deep structure  

This framework relocates “cognitive functions” from mysticism into:
- attentional science
- regulation psychology
- systems thinking
- potentially testable neuroscience

---

# Key Takeaway

People are not “a type.”

They are:
- anchored in one or more stabilisation axes
- moving through a geometry of emotional, rational, and perceptual regulation
- constantly negotiating between **field coherence** and **depth coherence**
