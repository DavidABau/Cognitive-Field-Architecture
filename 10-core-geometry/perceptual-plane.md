# Perceptual Reality Plane
### Ne / Ni / Se / Si — How Minds Stabilise Reality and Orientation

The Perceptual Reality Plane describes how humans orient themselves
in reality, possibility, time, and lived experience.

This plane is not about creativity or memory in a shallow sense.
It is about **how reality becomes stable enough to navigate.**

Like the other planes, it is organised around:

- Field Awareness (horizontal)
- Depth Awareness (vertical)

But because perception touches both *immediacy* and *time*, this plane expresses in four ways:

- conceptual possibility vs convergent meaning
- sensory immediacy vs experiential continuity

Together they define how the mind stays oriented.

## Ne — Conceptual Field Awareness
### Possibility and Emergent Potential

Ne stabilises reality by tuning to the **field of what could exist**.

It is oriented toward:
- possibility
- alternatives
- branching futures
- emergent patterns
- conceptual expansion

Its attention naturally extends outward into **open conceptual space**.

Ne perceives:
- multiple meanings at once
- unrealised potential
- alternative narratives that *could* be true
- how present moments could unfold into radically different futures

This is not randomness.
It is **field regulation applied to possibility.**

Ne treats reality as:
- dynamic
- unfolding
- never finished
- inherently capable of transformation

Ne stabilises by ensuring that reality is **not trapped in one frame**.

## Ni — Meaning Depth Awareness
### Convergent Interpretation and Inner Insight

Ni stabilises reality by tuning to **deep convergent meaning**.

It is oriented toward:
- distilled understanding
- symbolic compression
- singular coherent interpretation
- inner pattern convergence

Its attention gathers inward, refining toward **essence of meaning**.

Ni perceives:
- the “through-line” beneath noise
- symbolic or archetypal significance
- deep narrative coherence
- what something ultimately *is*

This is not mysticism.
It is **depth regulation applied to perception.**

Ni treats reality as:
- layered
- symbolic
- meaningful beneath the surface
- requiring interpretation to stabilise

Ni stabilises by ensuring reality is **understood at depth**, not scattered in possibilities.

## Se — Sensory Field Awareness
### Present Reality and Direct Contact

Se stabilises reality by tuning to the **immediate physical environment**.

It is oriented toward:
- live sensory data
- real-time responsiveness
- direct embodied contact with the world
- what is actually happening right now

Its attention anchors outward into **the living present field**.

Se perceives:
- concrete detail
- texture, motion, pattern in real time
- danger, opportunity, change in the environment
- the immediacy of experience itself

This is not impulsiveness.
It is **field regulation applied to sensory existence.**

Se treats reality as:
- physically real
- present
- undeniable
- best trusted when directly experienced

Se stabilises by grounding reality in **what is presently true.**

---

## Si — Continuity Depth Awareness
### Memory, Precedent, and Embodied Stability

Si stabilises reality by tuning to **continuity across time**.

It is oriented toward:
- memory
- familiarity
- pattern consistency
- lived precedent
- embodied experience

Its attention roots inward into **internalised lived history**.

Si perceives:
- how the present relates to the past
- what has been reliable before
- continuity of identity, body, and experience
- internal truth grounded in familiarity

This is not rigidity.
It is **depth regulation applied to time and experience.**

Si treats reality as:
- continuous
- accumulated
- embodied
- stable through repetition and memory

Si stabilises by grounding reality in **what has proven true over time.**

# Field vs Depth on This Plane

Each stabilises a different existential threat.

Ne stabilises **stagnation**  
Ni stabilises **meaning fragmentation**  
Se stabilises **disconnection from reality**  
Si stabilises **loss of continuity and identity**

None are optional.
They are complementary anchors.

# Why Humans Clash on This Plane

People often disagree not because they see different facts,  
but because they orient to different perceptual stabilisers.

Examples:

- Ne may see Ni as narrow, rigid, over-certain.
- Ni may see Ne as scattered, unfocused, lacking seriousness.
- Se may see Si as overly cautious or stuck in the past.
- Si may see Se as reckless or disconnected from lived wisdom.

Each protects something deeply important:

Ne protects **possibility.**  
Ni protects **meaning.**  
Se protects **reality.**  
Si protects **continuity.**

Most disagreements about “future,” “interpretation,” “risk,” or “experience”
make sense inside this geometry.

# Stress Behaviour

When stressed:

### Ne under stress
- spirals into endless possibilities
- loses grounding
- becomes anxious or chaotic

### Ni under stress
- locks into one interpretation
- becomes fatalistic or prophetic
- refuses contradictory information

### Se under stress
- overindulges or overreacts
- becomes compulsively reactive
- seeks stimulation or control of environment

### Si under stress
- retreats into familiarity
- resists change
- clings to precedent or ritual for safety

All are distortions of their stabilisation strategies.

# Healthy Integration

Growth expands perceptual bandwidth.

Healthy Ne learns:
- depth of commitment
- responsibility to reality

Healthy Ni learns:
- openness to revision
- tolerance for uncertainty

Healthy Se learns:
- long-term orientation
- continuity of identity

Healthy Si learns:
- flexibility
- willingness to enter the unknown

Integration is **breadth without losing anchor.**

## Summary

The Perceptual Reality Plane answers:

**How does a mind stabilise reality?**

Ne:
> By expanding into possibility.

Ni:
> By converging into meaning.

Se:
> By grounding in present experience.

Si:
> By anchoring in lived continuity.

Together, they create perceptual stability
that allows emotion and reason to operate coherently.

This plane continuously interacts with:
- the Emotional Meaning Plane
- the Rational Order Plane

Because reality, meaning, and order are inseparable in lived human experience.
